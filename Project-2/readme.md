<p> The dataset that contains a sample of 40 right-handed Anglo Introductory Psychology students at a large Southwestern university.
The students took four subtests (Vocabulary, Similarities, Block Design, and Picture Completion) of the Wechsler (1981) Adult
Intelligence Scale-Revised.
<p> The researchers used Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) to determine the brain size of the subjects. Information about gender and
body size (height and weight) are also included. The researchers suspended the weights of two subjects and the height of one subject
for reasons of confidentiality.

<p> Purpose of the project: To find the variables that have a stronger correlation with brain size (MRI_Count)

The datasets contains the following variables:
- <i> Gender </i>
- <i> FSIQ, Full Scale Intelligence Quotient </i>
- <i> VIQ, Verbal Intelligence Quotient </i>
- <i> PIQ, Performance Intelligence Quotient </i>
- <i> Weight and height </i>
- <i> MRI_Count relative to the brain size </i>
